# PDB
A folder that contains all the PDB files and shared code we can use to extract the right data from those files into your python code.

## Get Started


## Why a Pandas Dataframe?
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) define themselves as 'a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python.'

## I keep getting a large file warning, what should I do?
The PDB files are broken down into ~70 MB files, which is more than GitHub's reccomended 50 MB file size soft limit but less than their 100 MB hard cap. So, technically, you don't have to do anything. But if you really want to get rid of the warning you can download git-lfs (basically git for large files). Installing it is relatively straight-forward, just follow the instructions at [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com)
