# Error-Corrected Neural Networks

## PHASE 1: Make a ECNN Fiancial Model
Start by replicating the results of an existing [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05277.pdf) using ECNNs to make fiancial predictions.

## PHASE 2: Transfer the Architecture to Predict MD Simulations
Use the architecture in phase one to predict MD simulations from PDB files.

## PHASE 3: Refine the Model for Production
Review the various ways the model could be used and prepare for extension.

## PHASE 4: Create a GROMACS Extension
Make an extension to the GROMACS MD software using the documentation found [here](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/dev-manual/index.html)

# TODO:
- make a master pdb file with constant timesteps
